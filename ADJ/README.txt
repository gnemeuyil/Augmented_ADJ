The Augmented_Adjcluter.m and functions used in it are written according to the research work "Analysis of spectral space properties of directed graphs using matrix perturnation theory with application in graph partition". It is the main function that partitions a given directed group in accordance to the spectral space properties analyzed in the above work.

There are several scripts that can use the data provided to generate the results shown in the above work. 

The synthetic graph generator is included to produce graphs with various connectivity densities.

The twitter data set collected for the empirical evaluation section of the work is also included.
